**Assignment: Refactor code for Horiseon website**

**Description**
For this assignment, we were asked to refactor an existing single-page website for Horiseon. We were instructed to pay extra attention to accessibility and semantic HTML code.

I replaced all non-semantic HTML tags in 'index.html' with their semantic counterparts. Within the 'style.css' file, I condensed repeated code to make the site easier to maintain.
