**User Story**
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

**Acceptance Criteria**
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements

WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element

**Description**
This project is my attempt of refactoring the Horiseon's existing website homepage. 

The purposes of this refactoring is to make the previous code more efficient, comprehensible and accessible, through HTML5 and CSS best practice, and meeting the acceptance criteria as shown below. Refactoring should also result in improved search engine optimization. 

The modification does not change the displayed styling of the page, only the underlying code.

**Features**
Semantic HTML Structure: Replaced generic container elements and class names with appropriate semantic elements and semantic class names.
Page Headings: Ensured that heading elements follow a logical, sequential order.
Improved Image Accessibility: Added alt attributes to <img> tags to improve the experience of users visiting the page using assisitive technology.
Page Title: Added keyword driven page title to <title> element to improve SEO and help users with disabilities more quickly understand the page's content and purpose.
Comments were added throughout both HTML and CSS files, highlighting the improved semantic structure and changes.

**Development Enviromment**
Visual Studio Code
Terminal
Git

**Preview**
While the updates made to Horiseon's home page did not alter its overall appearance, the refactored structure underneath the page more clearly articulates the role each section plays in the document as a whole.
